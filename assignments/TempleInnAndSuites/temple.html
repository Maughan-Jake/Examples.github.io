                <h4>History</h4>

                <p>The Logan Utah Temple was the second temple built in Utah.</p>

                <p>The Logan Utah Temple was the first temple built with progressive-style muraled ordinance rooms for
                    live-acting
                    presentation of the endowment ceremony.</p>

                <p>The Logan Utah Temple was the only temple dedicated by President John Taylor.</p>

                <p>The Logan Utah Temple was originally named the Logan Temple.</p>

                <p>During a visit by the prophet, President Brigham Young, on August 22, 1863, Elder Wilford Woodruff
                    spoke to the young
                    people gathered and foretold of the coming of the Logan Utah Temple. He said: "You should never
                    forget this visitation.
                    You are to become men and women, fathers and mothers; yea, the day will come, after your fathers,
                    and these prophets
                    and apostles are dead, you will have the privilege of going into the towers of a glorious Temple
                    built unto the name of
                    the Most High (pointing in the direction of the bench), east of us upon the Logan bench; and while
                    you stand in the
                    towers of the Temple and your eyes survey this glorious valley filled with cities and villages,
                    occupied by tens of
                    thousands of Latter-day Saints, you will then call to mind this visitation of President Young and
                    his company."</p>

                <p>The five-story Logan Utah Temple was built entirely by volunteer labor over a seven-year period from
                    1877 to 1884.</p>

                <p>The exterior walls of the Logan Utah Temple were originally painted a pinkish off-white color to
                    hide the dark,
                    rough-hewn limestone. In the early 1900s, however, the paint was allowed to weather away,
                    uncovering the beautiful
                    stone that characterizes the temple today.</p>

                <p>On the evening of December 4, 1917, fire broke out in the Logan Utah Temple, engulfing the southeast
                    staircase,
                    destroying several windows and paintings, and causing extensive smoke and water damage. The origin
                    of the fire was
                    discovered to be electrical wiring.</p>

                <p>The Logan Utah Temple was floodlighted at night for the first time during the month of May 1934 as
                    part of the temple's
                    Golden Jubilee celebration. Everyone entering the valley was astonished by the brilliant spectacle.
                    Thirteen years
                    would pass before the temple was lit again on the temple's 63rd anniversary—this time with an
                    elaborate permanent
                    system.</p>

                <p>In 1976, the Logan Utah Temple was closed for over two years for a complete reconstruction of the
                    interior that
                    significantly increased its capacity. Despite the strong objections put forth by members who
                    treasured the handcrafted
                    interior and pioneer-era artwork, the historic temple was gutted and the roof removed, leaving only
                    the exterior walls
                    standing. The new 1970s-style interior was patterned after the recently completed Ogden Utah Temple
                    and Provo Utah
                    Temple. The muraled progressive-style ordinance rooms were replaced with wallpapered stationary
                    rooms equipped for
                    motion-picture presentation of the endowment. President Spencer W. Kimball, who rededicated the
                    temple in 1979,
                    regretted the need to rebuild the interior because of the loss of pioneer craftsmanship.</p>

                <p>In 2009, the Logan Utah Temple grounds were renovated, replacing the 1970s-style water feature with
                    a pioneer-inspired
                    oval reflecting pool. The new design incorporated several steps to serve as photograph areas and
                    added heated sidewalks
                    to combat the ample snowfall experienced in Cache Valley.</p>

            <article class="history">
                <h4>History</h4>
                <p>The San Diego California Temple was the third temple built in California, following the Los Angeles
                    California Temple (1956) and the Oakland California Temple (1964).</p>

                <p>The architects for the San Diego California Temple were William S. Lewis, Jr., design architect; Dennis Hyndman,
                    project architect; and Shelly Hyndman, interior design architect. The Hyndmans, who are Roman Catholic, had not toured
                    the interior of a Latter-day Saint temple until the Las Vegas Nevada Temple open house commenced in1989.</p>

                <p>After suffering a mild heart attack four months earlier, President Ezra Taft Benson made his first trip outside the
                    Salt Lake Valley to break ground for the San Diego California Temple—his first time presiding over a temple
                    groundbreaking.</p>

                <p>On Monday, December 23, 1991, the 186th anniversary of the birth of the Prophet Joseph Smith, a gilded statue of the
                    angel Moroni was installed atop the eastern spire of the San Diego California Temple. Shortly after the setting, a
                    traveling flock of seagulls—a bird of symbolic significance to the Church—circled the new statue about three times
                    before continuing on its course.</p>

                <p>Over 720,000 visitors attended the widely publicized open house of the San Diego California Temple.</p>

                <p>President Benson's ailing health did not allow him to preside at the dedication of the San Diego California Temple.
                    President Gordon B. Hinckley was assigned to dedicate the temple in 23 sessions where 49,273 persons attended.</p>

                <p>The San Diego California Temple was honored as Headliner of the Year for 1993 in the landmark
                    category by the San Diego Press Club.</p>

                <p>For its efforts during the open house of the San Diego California Temple to increase public awareness of the Church and
                    the role of the temple, the Church was presented with the Public Relations Society of America's prestigious Silver
                    Anvil Award in the category of special events and observances by non-profit organizations.</p>

                <p>The Bountiful Utah Temple was the eighth temple built in Utah and the first built in Davis County.

                    <p>The floor plan created for the Bountiful Utah Temple was adapted and used for the Mount Timpanogos Utah Temple.</p>

                    <p>The Bountiful Utah Temple is one of only two temples dedicated by President Howard W. Hunter during his brief time as
                        president of the Church. (The other is the Orlando Florida Temple.)</p>

                    <p>At the groundbreaking ceremony for the Bountiful Utah Temple, some 7,500 people gathered on the site with another 2,500
                        viewing the proceedings by remote video. The crowd was so large, some attenders opted to sit on the steep hillside east
                        of the site.</p>

                    <p>President Gordon B. Hinckley alluded to the forthcoming announcements of the Hong Kong China Temple, Preston England
                        Temple, and Hartford Connecticut Temple at the Bountiful Utah Temple groundbreaking, indicating that official
                        announcements would not be made until sites had been acquired and approved.</p>

                    <p>During the six weeks that the Bountiful Utah Temple was open for public tours, 870,361 visitors walked its beautiful
                         rooms and hallways, assisted by 45,000 volunteers.</p>

                    <p>At the 28 dedicatory sessions of the Bountiful Utah Temple, 201,655 members were in attendance—the largest number of
                        attenders at a temple dedication in the history of the Church.</p>

                    <p>On May 22, 2016, lightning struck the angel Moroni atop the Bountiful Utah Temple, cracking the exterior gold leaf and
                        removing chunks from the face and back of the fiberglass statue. On June 1, 2016, a replacement Moroni was set in
                        place.</p>

                <h4>History</h4>
                <p>The Philadelphia Pennsylvania Temple will be the first temple built in Pennsylvania.</p>

                <p>Elder Jay E. Jensen of the Presidency of the Seventy unveiled the official rendering of the Philadelphia Pennsylvania
                    Temple for the first time at a VIP event held prior to a Mormon Tabernacle Choir concert in Philadelphia's Mann Center
                    on June 24, 2011.</p>

                <p>The Philadelphia Pennsylvania Temple was designed in the neoclassical style with a wall height that matches the height
                    of the neighboring neoclassical Philadelphia Family Court Building (soon to be repurposed as a hotel) and Philadelphia
                    Free Library, both located just west of the temple.</p>
